# NLP Word Embeddings Exploration

## Overview
This project is an exploration into word embeddings using PyTorch. It includes a Python script, `findsim.py`, that calculates the similarity between word embeddings and performs analogy tasks.

## Features
- Calculation of cosine similarity between word embeddings.
- Identification of the ten most similar words to a given word.
- Handling word analogies using vector arithmetic (e.g., `king - man + woman`).

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch for vectorized operations and handling word embeddings.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/benchang323/NLP-Word-Embeddings-Exploration.git
cd NLP-Word-Embeddings-Exploration
```
